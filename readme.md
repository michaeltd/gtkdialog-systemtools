gtkdialog gentoo-systemtools

# Yes but ...Why?
1. As a central gathering point of various operations in the gentoo distribution.
2. Convenience

## What's new
  * Repurposed from rpm based distro to gentoo
  * Lost zenity in favor of the first available terminal editor
  * Lost multiple gtkdialog button actions for concurrencies sake
  * Lost various temp files for a central exported temp file.
